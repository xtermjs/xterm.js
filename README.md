# [![xterm.js logo](images/logo-full.png)](https://xtermjs.org)

Xterm.js is a front-end component written in TypeScript that lets applications bring fully-featured terminals to their users in the browser. It's used by popular projects such as VS Code, Hyper and Theia.
 
## Features

- **Terminal apps just work**: Xterm.js works with most terminal apps such as `bash`, `vim`, and `tmux`, including support for curses-based apps and mouse events.
- **Performant**: Xterm.js is *really* fast, it even includes a GPU-accelerated renderer.
- **Rich Unicode support**: Supports CJK, emojis, and IMEs.
- **Self-contained**: Requires zero dependencies to work.
- **Accessible**: Screen reader and minimum contrast ratio support can be turned on.
- **And much more**: Links, theming, addons, well documented API, etc.

## What xterm.js is not

- Xterm.js is not a terminal application that you can download and use on your computer.
- Xterm.js is not `bash`. Xterm.js can be connected to processes like `bash` and let you interact with them (provide input, receive output).

## Getting Started

First, you need to install the module, we ship exclusively through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), so you need that installed and then add xterm.js as a dependency by running:

```bash
npm install @xterm/xterm
```

To start using xterm.js on your browser, add the `xterm.js` and `xterm.css` to the head of your HTML page. Then create a `<div id="terminal"></div>` onto which xterm can attach itself. Finally, instantiate the `Terminal` object and then call the `open` function with the DOM object of the `div`.

```html
<!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@xterm/xterm/css/xterm.css" />
      <script src="node_modules/@xterm/xterm/lib/xterm.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="terminal"></div>
      <script>
        var term = new Terminal();
        term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));
        term.write('Hello from \x1B[1;3;31mxterm.js\x1B[0m $ ')
      </script>
    </body>
  </html>
```

### Importing

The recommended way to load xterm.js is via the ES6 module syntax:

```javascript
import { Terminal } from '@xterm/xterm';
```

### Addons

⚠️ *This section describes the new addon format introduced in v3.14.0, see [here](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/3.14.2/README.md#addons) for the instructions on the old format*

Addons are separate modules that extend the `Terminal` by building on the [xterm.js API](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/master/typings/xterm.d.ts). To use an addon, you first need to install it in your project:

```bash
npm i -S @xterm/addon-web-links
```

Then import the addon, instantiate it and call `Terminal.loadAddon`:

```ts
import { Terminal } from '@xterm/xterm';
import { WebLinksAddon } from '@xterm/addon-web-links';

const terminal = new Terminal();
// Load WebLinksAddon on terminal, this is all that's needed to get web links
// working in the terminal.
terminal.loadAddon(new WebLinksAddon());
```

The xterm.js team maintains the following addons, but anyone can build them:

- [`@xterm/addon-attach`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/addon-attach): Attaches to a server running a process via a websocket
- [`@xterm/addon-clipboard`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/addon-clipboard): Access the browser's clipboard
- [`@xterm/addon-fit`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/addon-fit): Fits the terminal to the containing element
- [`@xterm/addon-image`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/addon-image): Adds image support
- [`@xterm/addon-search`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/addon-search): Adds search functionality
- [`@xterm/addon-serialize`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/addon-serialize): Serializes the terminal's buffer to a VT sequences or HTML
- [`@xterm/addon-unicode11`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/addon-unicode11): Updates character widths to their unicode11 values
- [`@xterm/addon-web-links`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/addon-web-links): Adds web link detection and interaction
- [`@xterm/addon-webgl`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/addon-webgl): Renders xterm.js using a `canvas` element's webgl2 context

## Browser Support

Since xterm.js is typically implemented as a developer tool, only modern browsers are supported officially. Specifically the latest versions of *Chrome*, *Edge*, *Firefox*, and *Safari*.

Xterm.js works seamlessly in [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) apps and may even work on earlier versions of the browsers. These are the versions we strive to keep working.

### Node.js Support

We also publish [`xterm-headless`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xterm-headless) which is a stripped down version of xterm.js that runs in Node.js. An example use case for this is to keep track of a terminal's state where the process is running and using the serialize addon so it can get all state restored upon reconnection.

## API

The full API for xterm.js is contained within the [TypeScript declaration file](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/master/typings/xterm.d.ts), use the branch/tag picker in GitHub (`w`) to navigate to the correct version of the API.

Note that some APIs are marked *experimental*, these are added to enable experimentation with new ideas without committing to support it like a normal [semver](https://semver.org/) API. Note that these APIs can change radically between versions, so be sure to read release notes if you plan on using experimental APIs.

## Releases

Xterm.js follows a monthly release cycle roughly.

All current and past releases are available on this repo's [Releases page](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/releases), you can view the [high-level roadmap on the wiki](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/wiki/Roadmap) and see what we're working on now by looking through [Milestones](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js/milestones).

### Beta builds

Our CI releases beta builds to npm for every change that goes into master. Install the latest beta build with:

```bash
npm install -S @xterm/xterm@beta
```

These should generally be stable, but some bugs may slip in. We recommend using the beta build primarily to test out new features and to verify bug fixes.

## Contributing
