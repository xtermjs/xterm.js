# xterm.js — xterm, in the browser

Xterm.js is a full xterm clone, written completely in JavaScript.

Xterm.js supplies a modular, event-based interface that lets developers build addons and themes that augment  the experience of running a fully-featured terminal inside the browser.

Xterm.js serves as foundation for the terminal found at www.sourcelair.com.
